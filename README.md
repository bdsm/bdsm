### If someone ever offers you crack or cocaine, be smart - just say NO!

*I mainly push stuff related to personal sites and other random things I use. I'll occasionally try to version bump an ebuild or something, but overall, pretty boring. Things go here primarily for my own organization.*

* Likes: \*BSD, Plan 9, ThinkPads, Go, Ruby
* Dislikes: Artificial grape flavoring

If you want to say something about me, PR this README and add text below I guess.
