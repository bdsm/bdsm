### X230

My primary machine when I'm not talking to someone or playing games at this point. Typically runs OpenBSD, but previously ran NixOS.   

[me-cleaned](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner) and [corebooted](https://github.com/merge/skulls) with [modified embedded controller firmware](https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec) for keyboard and battery purposes.
